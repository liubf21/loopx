# pr_review_command_v0

`pr_review_command_v0` defines the `/loopx-pr-review` command. It helps a
user review open and recently merged pull requests one by one by turning public
GitHub PR metadata into a guided review queue.

The reviewed repository is the caller's current GitHub project by default, as
resolved by `gh`, or the explicit `--repo owner/repo` target. LoopX's own
repository may be used for dogfood and public fixtures, but the command is not
LoopX-repo-specific.

The command is read-only. It does not approve reviews, post PR comments, merge,
push, spend LoopX quota, or mark LoopX todos complete.

The built-in `pull-request-review` capability adds an optional autonomous
observation to this same command. It reuses the existing GitHub scan and
normalized review queue; it does not introduce a second crawler or a new write
authority.

The capability also owns the review-depth contract. The shared
`agent_response_contract.review_execution_contract` defines required evidence,
completion, freshness, finding, and verdict rules. Each PR carries a compact
`review_plan` that binds those rules to one exact head and marks code-symbol and
negative-walkthrough applicability. Host skills route and publish this packet;
they must not maintain a second explanation checklist.

Codex agents should use the dedicated `loopx-pr-review` skill for this slash
command. Do not route `/loopx-pr-review` through the broader `loopx-project`
workflow or the merge-focused `loopx-pr-merge` skill.

## Command

| Command | CLI reference | Intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/loopx-pr-review` | `loopx pr-review [--repo owner/repo] [--state open\|merged\|all] [--since ISO]` | List open and merged PRs for the current project or explicit repository, provide concrete main-regression analysis for each PR, and include a blank five-block template that agentloop fills after reading the selected PR body/diff. |

The slash command must run the CLI first. Agentloop must not reconstruct the
review window by manually calling `gh pr view` / `gh pr list` for every PR. The
CLI packet's `review_groups.unmerged`, `review_groups.merged`, and
`pull_requests[].review_template` are the authoritative queue. The packet's
`evidence_commands` are for the second step: reading one selected PR deeply.
Use the JSON form for the first pass so the response contract and per-PR blank
templates enter the model context:

```bash
loopx --format json pr-review --state all [--repo owner/repo] [--since ISO]
```

For an autonomous maintainer monitor, request the complete open queue and the
read-only observation packet:

```bash
loopx --format json pr-review --repo owner/repo --state open \
  --autonomous-observation
```

On a later poll, pass either the prior `autonomous_review` object or the full
prior PR-review packet:

```bash
loopx --format json pr-review --repo owner/repo --state open \
  --autonomous-observation \
  --previous-observation-json previous.json
```

After the selected candidate has an externally verifiable review or
merge-readiness result at that exact head, advance the queue with an explicit
handled cursor:

```bash
loopx --format json pr-review --repo owner/repo --state open \
  --autonomous-observation \
  --previous-observation-json previous.json \
  --handled-exact-head 2768@0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```

`--handled-exact-head` is repeatable and uses `NUMBER@HEAD_OID`. The observation
persists these public-safe cursors in `handled_exact_heads`. Candidate emission
alone is not a completion receipt: callers must add the cursor only after
review-result readback proves that exact head was handled. A newly supplied
cursor must match the prior packet's candidate or one of its
`projected_candidate_exact_heads`; a caller cannot skip an unselected PR by
naming it handled. A new head is a new candidate even when the prior head was
handled.

`pending_candidate_exact_head` preserves the last selected but unhandled exact
head across unchanged and incomplete polls. It is a scheduling cursor only;
callers still deduplicate Todo creation by exact target key and must not treat
the cursor as evidence that a review happened.

`projected_candidate_exact_heads` persists every candidate that has been emitted
but not yet completed. An unchanged poll skips those projected exact heads and
selects the next unprojected, unhandled PR in the existing review sequence, so
the monitor keeps rotating through the backlog instead of waiting on one PR.
When every actionable PR has already been projected, `candidate` is `None` and
`pending_candidate_exact_head` remains the last pending cursor. A material
transition on an already projected exact head still re-selects that head.

`review_backlog` gives the monitor a compact workload cadence hint. It counts
open, non-draft PRs whose exact head is actionable and not yet recorded in
`handled_exact_heads`, and returns `recommended_poll_interval_minutes`. While at
least one unhandled PR remains, the recommendation is `3`; once the actionable
backlog is empty, it drops to `15`. The hint is scheduling evidence only: it
does not grant Todo, review, comment, or merge authority, and callers still
advance the queue with an explicit handled cursor after exact-head review
readback.

`pull_request_review_queue_observation_v0` has exactly three observation
states:

- `not_observed`: the source or packet slice was incomplete. Preserve the
  previous baseline and do not claim the queue is unchanged.
- `observed_unchanged`: a complete observation has the same queue fingerprint.
  Do not create a duplicate exact-head Todo for a projected candidate. The
  packet selects the next unprojected, unhandled backlog PR so the queue keeps
  rotating. An unhandled candidate remains in `projected_candidate_exact_heads`
  until the caller supplies its completion cursor.
- `material_transition`: a complete observation changed an exact head, review
  decision, check state, draft state, mergeability, or open-queue membership.

The repository-scoped fingerprint contains only compact public PR metadata.
Persisted `items` carry only PR number and item fingerprint, so the autonomous
packet does not duplicate the full review queue. The capability selects at
most one unhandled, non-draft open PR in the existing `pr-review` sequence:
changed PRs first, then an unchanged poll rotates to the next unprojected
candidate. Projected-but-unhandled candidates are skipped until they are
handled or their exact head materially changes.
It emits a
`pull_request_review_todo_preview_v0` bound to its exact head. The preview may
route to initial review, re-review after changes, or merge-readiness
qualification. It grants no Todo write, GitHub review/comment, push, or merge
authority; callers must use normal LoopX Todo authority, `loopx-pr-review`, and
`loopx-pr-merge` policy for those actions.

Do not pipe that first packet through `jq` or another projection that only
keeps `.summary` and `.review_sequence`; that drops
`agent_response_contract`, `review_groups`, `pull_requests[].review_template`,
`pull_requests[].review_plan`, and `pull_requests[].evidence_commands`, which
are the fields that make the command a guided review instead of a statistics
table.

## Capability-Owned Review Execution

`pull_request_review_execution_contract_v1` is shared once per packet to avoid
duplicating a large prompt for every PR in a 100-item queue. It requires these
typed evidence groups before a verdict:

- problem context and active caller;
- architecture and ownership flow;
- exact changed-line classification across production, tests/fixtures, docs,
  generated output, and mechanical moves;
- a 2-5 item exact-head symbol map for code-changing PRs, including caller,
  state, branch, side effect, consumer, and failure ownership;
- positive and applicable negative execution walkthroughs;
- validation tied to changed invariants and failure cases;
- strongest regression path, blast radius, recovery, minimum repair, and
  regression test;
- code-volume necessity and the highest-value behavior-preserving
  simplification.

The per-PR `pull_request_review_plan_v1` records the exact target, applicability,
required evidence ids, and an initially `unverified`
`pull_request_review_result_v1` skeleton. Metadata, labels, file counts, risk
hints, and green CI cannot upgrade evidence to `verified`. A stale-head verdict
is prohibited. Missing evidence remains `unverified` with a reason instead of
being replaced by confident prose.

When `--state all` is used, the command must preserve both lifecycle groups.
The `--limit` value is applied per group so a busy open queue cannot consume the
whole packet and make `review_groups.merged` empty while merged PRs exist in the
window. The default is 100 PRs per selected group. Every packet carries
`result_completeness`; exhaustive requests must require `complete=true` and
rerun with its `recommended_limit` when the source scan or packet slice was
truncated. Live GitHub reads should fetch open and closed/merged windows
separately before constructing the grouped packet.

The agent response must not stop at a queue table. For `/loopx-pr-review`, the
queue is only the preface; the final answer should review selected PRs one by
one with five sections: `动机`, `改动思路`, `具体改动`, `对主干的风险`, and
`我的整体评价`. A stats/list-only response is valid only when the user
explicitly asks for stats or a list without review. When the visible message
starts with `/loopx-pr-review`, words such as `open`, `closed`, `merged`,
`today`, or a time window are filters on the review queue, not permission to
skip the review. Downgrade only for explicit opt-out phrases such as `只统计`,
`只列出`, `stats only`, `list only`, `不要 review`, or `不用分析`.

The published review is a full-PR bilingual review: one complete Chinese
five-block review covering every changed surface, key symbol, positive and
negative path, and validation, plus one concise English machine verdict
(`APPROVE`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or the author-owned `COMMENTED` fallback). The
Chinese review carries the depth and evidence; the English verdict carries the
machine-readable state and validation summary. A findings-only or blocker-only
body is not a complete PR review.

Each complete PR review must also include whole-PR interpretation depth:
per-file responsibility mapping, 2-5 key symbol explanations with exact-head
references, one positive runtime walkthrough, one negative/fail-closed
walkthrough, per-surface validation, and an overall judgment for the entire PR.

## Source Reads

Implementations may read compact public PR surfaces:

- pull request title, number, URL, branch, author, lifecycle state, merge time,
  and review decision;
- PR body summary;
- changed-file list and diff scale;
- status-check rollup;
- merge-state metadata.

Commit headlines may be used as optional single-PR deep-review evidence, but
the default window review should not require fetching them for every PR.

They must not include raw logs, private connector payloads, credentials, local
absolute paths, private source bodies, or hidden CI artifacts.

## Review Flow

The packet should let a reviewer move through PRs in order:

1. Start from `review_groups.unmerged` for PRs that can still affect merge
   decisions.
2. Then use `review_groups.merged` for post-merge audit and follow-up quality.
3. Use `evidence_commands`, key files, changed-file scale, and checks to open
   the actual PR body and diff.
4. Execute the PR's `review_plan` against
   `agent_response_contract.review_execution_contract`; keep unavailable
   evidence explicitly unverified.
5. Read `main_regression_analysis` before filling risk prose. It is the CLI's
   concrete, generated view of potential main regressions, bug risks, and
   focused validation.
6. Render the verified structured result through the blank five-block template:
   `动机`, `改动思路`, `具体改动`, `对主干的风险`, `我的整体评价`.
   Use each section's range as a depth signal for a reader unfamiliar with the
   subsystem, not as filler.
7. Treat `metadata_risk_hint` only as queue-ordering metadata. It must not be
   copied as the final risk judgement.
8. Recheck the exact head, then decide `approve`, `request changes`, `defer`, or
   `merge after checks`.

A response that only lists `Open` and `Merged` PRs, scale, and recommended next
order is incomplete for `/loopx-pr-review`; it should continue into the
per-PR five-block review cards after reading evidence.

Similarly, a response that says it ran `loopx pr-review` but used a command like
`loopx --format json pr-review ... | jq '.summary, .review_sequence'` is still
incomplete: the tool call happened, but the contract/template fields were
discarded before the agent planned its answer.

## Acceptance Checks

A first implementation is acceptable when:

- `loopx slash-commands` exposes `/loopx-pr-review`;
- `loopx pr-review` returns `loopx_pr_review_command_response_v0`;
- default live reads use the caller's current `gh` repository, while
  `--repo owner/repo` can review another GitHub project;
- `--state all` includes merged PRs in the same packet, applies `--limit` per
  lifecycle group, and keeps `review_groups.merged` non-empty when merged PRs
  exist in the requested window; `--state open` preserves the old open-only
  review queue;
- the default limit is 100, and exhaustive requests only proceed when
  `result_completeness.complete=true`; truncated packets provide a larger
  `recommended_limit` for the next read;
- `--since` can bound an overnight or release-window review without relying on
  private chat memory;
- the response includes review sequence, changed-file scope, status checks,
  key files, risk notes, metadata-only risk hints, concrete
  `main_regression_analysis`, evidence commands, explicit
  `review_groups.unmerged` / `review_groups.merged`, and a blank five-block
  review template;
- the shared `pull_request_review_execution_contract_v1` owns typed evidence,
  completion, freshness, findings-first, and verdict policy, while every PR has
  a compact exact-head `pull_request_review_plan_v1` with an unverified result
  skeleton;
- the packet includes `agent_response_contract.table_only_response_allowed=false`
  and `agent_response_contract.required_packet_fields_to_preserve` so
  slash-command agents know a table-only chat answer is incomplete;
- the slash-command catalog marks `/loopx-pr-review` as `must_run_cli_first`
  and `slash_prefix_dominates_intent`, and says manual `gh` calls are only
  per-PR deep-read commands after the CLI packet selects a PR;
- each PR includes `review_template.sections` for `动机`, `改动思路`,
  `具体改动`, `对主干的风险`, and `我的整体评价`;
- each review template section carries a section-specific depth range, and the
  packet's explanation-depth contract requires problem, architecture,
  implementation, validation, necessity, and risk evidence instead of a generic
  long answer;
- live packets expose and recheck `headRefOid` so a review verdict is bound to
  the remote revision actually inspected;
- template sections must leave `content` empty so agentloop reads the real PR
  before writing the review;
- `metadata_risk_hint` must be repository-generic and must not special-case
  LoopX files or domains;
- `main_regression_analysis` must be repository-generic, must include
  `potential_regressions`, `bug_risks`, and `verification_focus`, and must not
  be replaced by a blank template;
- live GitHub reads and fixture-based smokes share the same schema;
- no raw logs, private payloads, credentials, local paths, or private source
  bodies are recorded.
