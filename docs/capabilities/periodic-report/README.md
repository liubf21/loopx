# Periodic report

`periodic-report` is LoopX's reusable reporting capability. It gives any
project a stable report-run envelope while leaving source semantics, cadence,
presentation, and destinations to profiles and adapters.

| Surface | Value |
| --- | --- |
| CLI | `loopx periodic-report evaluate-trigger --request-json <path>` and `compose-run` |
| Protocol | [`periodic_report_v0`](../../reference/protocols/periodic-report-v0.md) |
| Smoke | `python3 examples/periodic-report-smoke.py` |

The capability is intentionally effect-free. It first evaluates scheduled or
material progress facts into a deterministic trigger receipt, then composes a
run with stable run and sink idempotency, typed source snapshots, artifact and
sink receipts, explicit partial/unknown outcomes, and bounded retry guidance.
It performs no provider read or write.

Reportable transitions include a due cadence, a validated primary outcome, a
validated vision closure with either a successor or terminal goal, material
route decisions, primary-path blockers and recoveries, and authorized manual
runs. Ordinary todo completion, unchanged monitors, state refreshes,
surface-only events, and intermediate vision checkpoints are suppressed.
Profiles can enable trigger kinds and set a minimum interval; urgent outcome,
closure, blocker, and manual triggers may bypass that interval. Concurrent
material facts are coalesced into one report and previously covered trigger
ids are deduplicated.

Project-specific weekly reports should be layered as profiles and adapters.
For example, a maintenance profile may choose a local timezone and weekly
cadence, collect repository and discussion signals, render a team card, archive
the artifact, and deliver it to a configured channel. None of those choices
becomes an invariant of the shared core.

This is a built-in capability, not an extension: callers need the trigger,
idempotency, retry, and receipt contract even when no provider is installed.
Optional or independently versioned collectors, renderers, archive stores, and
message transports remain extension providers (or built-in adapters) that
implement the capability's ports without owning its lifecycle.

## Built-in renderers

- `markdown_v0` produces a compact linear artifact for documents and message
  adapters.
- `html_artifact_v0` produces a self-contained, zero-build HTML artifact with
  responsive section cards, source-health summaries, section filtering, and
  text search. It has no external runtime dependency and escapes all source
  content before rendering.

HTML generation is separate from publication. A static-site, Lark HTML, or
other hosting adapter may publish the artifact and return an exact readback
receipt, but the renderer neither chooses a destination nor performs a write.
Project profiles still own language, layout policy, audience, cadence, and
selection rules.
