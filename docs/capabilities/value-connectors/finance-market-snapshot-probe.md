# Finance Market Snapshot Probe Packet

Status: public-safe no-credential probe packet for `finance_market_snapshot`.

This packet records what LoopX can safely learn before building a live finance
connector. It is not a trading adapter, not an account adapter, and not an
investment-advice surface.

## Scope

Allowed in this probe:

- public, no-credential network reads;
- source and endpoint metadata;
- compact field-shape observations;
- source freshness, terms, and uncertainty labels;
- user gates for account, paid-data, private portfolio, or trading surfaces.

Forbidden in this probe:

- account login, Futu OpenD connection, private portfolio reads, account ids,
  paid-data signup, captcha handling, credentials, or cookies;
- trading, order placement, portfolio mutation, or production actions;
- price targets, suitability claims, guaranteed-return wording, or personal
  investment advice;
- raw provider payloads or raw paid-provider responses in LoopX state.

## Source Findings

| Source | Probe result | Candidate use | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Futu OpenAPI / OpenD | Official docs describe OpenD as the gateway program and require local/cloud OpenD setup before API use. Official quota docs also describe quote-right permissions and market-specific data rights. | High-quality user-owned terminal path when the user already has OpenD, API agreements, account permission, and quote rights. | Exact user gate before any connection, login, quote subscription, account metadata, portfolio, or trade API call. |
| Eastmoney public quote endpoint | No-credential probe reached `https://push2.eastmoney.com/api/qt/stock/get` for two A-share examples and observed compact JSON with a `data` object plus allowlist-shaped quote fields. | First public metadata canary for A-share quote snapshots. | Treat as `source_unverified` until source terms, stability, throttling, symbol mapping, and freshness semantics are reviewed. |
| Eastmoney quote page | No-credential probe reached `https://quote.eastmoney.com/sh600519.html` as public HTML. | Human-visible source URL and fallback inspection label. | Do not scrape hidden page state into LoopX; prefer compact endpoint field allowlists. |
| AKShare | Public GitHub repo describes a broad Python financial data interface and explicitly warns that data is for academic/reference use and not investment advice. | GitHub OSS fallback for China-market quote, fund, news, and announcement connectors. | Preserve upstream data-risk and non-advice warnings; check source-origin and interface freshness per function. |
| efinance | PyPI describes an Eastmoney-based open-source Python library for stock, fund, and futures data, with MIT metadata. | Lightweight Eastmoney-backed fallback candidate for China-market snapshots. | Same Eastmoney source-origin, freshness, and terms gate applies. |
| yfinance | Public GitHub repo describes a Yahoo Finance API wrapper and says it is unaffiliated with Yahoo, for research/educational or personal-use contexts subject to Yahoo terms. | US-stock/ETF fallback candidate for non-China symbols. | Terms/use-right review required before automated or repeated use. |
| py-futu-api | Public GitHub repo is the Futu OpenAPI Python SDK. | SDK layer after the Futu user gate, not a no-credential fallback. | Requires OpenD/account/quote-right gate first. |

## Recommended Next Slice

Implement a dry-run-only `finance_market_snapshot` canary before any live
adapter:

1. accept a tiny symbol allowlist such as `sh600519` and `sz000001`;
2. call only the public Eastmoney quote endpoint with explicit timeout and user
   agent;
3. emit only compact allowlisted fields and field-presence metadata, not raw
   provider payloads;
4. label every result `source_unverified` until terms/freshness are reviewed;
5. fail closed to a user gate for Futu/OpenD, private portfolio, paid data,
   trading, captcha, or credential paths.
